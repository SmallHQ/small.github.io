Are You Prepared for It?</h1> <p> I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve heard of successful SaaS products like <a href="//basecamp.com">Basecamp</a>, <a href="//letsfreckle.com">Freckle</a>, and <a href="//bidsketch.com">Bidsketch</a>. These were the companies that inspired us personally to go down the SaaS route. If they could do it, so could we&hellip;right?</p> <p> I wish it were that simple! Building a <strong>bootstrapped</strong> SaaS business is really, really, really frickin&#39; hard.</p> <p> You can have popular blog posts, a huge list of prospects, a successful beta, and even launch into revenue/profit. But without revenue streams besides your SaaS, you will&nbsp;likely fail in the first year.</p> <p> That&rsquo;s right, your self-funded venture will fail if you don&rsquo;t do one of the following:</p> <ol> <li> Sell a product/productized service (book, course, membership site, webinar, etc.)</li> <li> Sell your time (consulting)</li> <li> Sell your time (part- or full-time job)</li> </ol> <p> Most SaaS founders don&rsquo;t talk about this reality.</p> <p> But <strong>a huge majority of the founders</strong> we&rsquo;ve talked to so far (<a href="//howtobuildarocketship.com/podcast">on the podcast</a>) spend their first few months/years making their money from sources besides their SaaS product. And many of them continue offering high-end services far after their SaaS becomes &ldquo;successful&rdquo;.</p> <p> Don&rsquo;t believe me? We&rsquo;ve heard it first-hand from entrepreneurs like <a href="https://twitter.com/brennandunn">Brennan Dunn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/toddo">Todd Garland</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/drewwilson">Drew Wilson</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/earthlingworks">Ruben Gamez</a>.</p> <p> It&rsquo;s not fun or sexy to think about these sorts of things when you&rsquo;d much rather be spending your time working on your baby: that one thing that brings you closer to full freedom than you&rsquo;ve ever been.&nbsp;</p> <p> But the sooner you embrace this <em>(we waited way too long),</em> the longer your runway will be and the less stress you&rsquo;ll inflict on yourself and those around you. So let&rsquo;s get down to it:</p> <h2> 0. Don&rsquo;t Turn Down (Good) Consulting Work</h2> <p> We&rsquo;ve avoided consulting work like the plague. And it&rsquo;s been great&hellip;it&rsquo;s allowed us to push our products forward at a great rate. But even at a great rate, SaaS revenue takes a long time to build.</p> <p> Absolutely turn down long-term contract projects that would distract you or your team. But think twice before rejecting/not pursuing retainer work.</p> <p> I highly recommend <a href="//doubleyourfreelancingrate.com/">Brennan&rsquo;s book</a>. It convinced us to charge 5x our normal rate on the only contract we&rsquo;ve taken since we started. His advice also helped us extend that job into a monthly retainer which is locked in for 12 months now, giving us some level of stability.</p> <h2> 1. Market Your Product before You Build It</h2> <p> Before you start building your product, put up a simple, yet descriptive, page selling the dream (<a href="//www.minimalytics.com">here&rsquo;s one of ours</a>). Don&rsquo;t use LaunchRock, and don&rsquo;t skimp on design. If you&rsquo;re truly keeping it simple, you should be able to find a great designer on Dribbble that will produce a style guide to keep you on track. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but when I see a half-assed landing page, I assume the eventual product won&rsquo;t have any polish/effort invested either.</p> <p> This page is your calling card. Anyone you interact with on Twitter or in Email will be viewing your product&rsquo;s page and judging your competency as a maker. All of your future outreach/reputation as an entrepreneur depend on this page.</p> <h2> 2. Use this Marketing to Build a Personal Newsletter that Attracts Your Audience</h2> <p> We&rsquo;ve been operating for nearly a year, and this is the first time we&rsquo;ve sat down and thought about what we could send of value to the folks that have signed up for the Small HQ list.</p> <p> All of our prior focus has been on growing beta lists, and upon realizing how slow SaaS is, we&rsquo;re now making an attempt to grow the company outside of the SaaS.&nbsp;</p> <p> What can you do to provide value to your audience on a regular basis, regardless of whether or not it supports your SaaS?</p> <h2> 3. Sell an eBook or other Non-SaaS Product to this Audience</h2> <p> We started promoting our book about 6-9 months ago. Then it sat there, ignored. It wasn&rsquo;t until <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelsacca">Michael Sacca</a> approached us about partnering up on a broader book that we got our asses in gear. Since then, we&rsquo;ve started publishing our <a href="//howtobuildarocketship.com/podcast">founder interviews</a>, and have many more plans for the <a href="//howtobuildarocketship.com">Rocketship</a> brand.</p> <p> We should have been doing all of this work last summer, but instead we were focused on building (and then rebuilding) our <a href="//www.hookfeed.com">SaaS</a> <a href="//www.minimalytics.com">products</a>.</p> <p> Don&rsquo;t make the same mistake. Sell your knowledge, and give a lot away for free. Let that momentum fuel your product development.</p> <h2> 4. Build Your Product along the Way</h2> <p> If you do everything right, you should have some side-revenue coming in from 1 or more non-SaaS products. More importantly, you will have built up relationships which can be turned into partnerships on other products/services.</p> <p> It took us a very long time to realize what works and what doesn&rsquo;t, and we&rsquo;ve continued to be fairly non-deliberate in our actions. Moving forward, we&rsquo;re trying to be more strategic about where we spend our energy. Focusing most on revenue-driving activities, and less on distracting side-projects/our SaaS.</p> <p> <em><span style="font-size:14px;">&ldquo;The end of 2013 marks roughly the three-year mark for my company. As I reflect on where we are today, from initial product, to an advisory round, to seed funding and then to raising our Series A in December 2013, one thing that I&rsquo;ve always perceived came true: <strong>it takes roughly 3 years for you to truly figure out if what you&rsquo;re working on can be a business.</strong>&rdquo; </span></em><br/> <span style="font-size:14px;">&ndash;&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Tawheed">Tawheed Kader</a>, <a href="//www1.toutapp.com/">Tout App</a></span></p> </div> </div> </section> <section id=sharing_banner> <div id=sharing class=container> <div class="ten columns offset-by-three"> <div id=anchor_divider>e</div> <p>If you liked this article it would mean a lot to me if you'd share it!</p> <div id=twitter> <a href="https://twitter.com/share" class=twitter-share-button>Tweet</a> </div> <div id=buffer> <a href="//bufferapp.com/add" class=buffer-add-button data-count=horizontal>Buffer</a><script src="//static.bufferapp.com/js/button.js"></script> </div> <div id=googleplus> <div class=g-plusone></div> </div> <div class=createsend-button style="height:27px;display:inline-block;" data-listid="r/EE/F07/73C/36EF65FEFFEF7FE1"> </div><script>(function () { var e = document.createElement('script'); e.type = 'text/javascript'; e.async = true; e.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
