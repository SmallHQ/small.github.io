  Hey [firstname,fallback=there],</p>
<p>
  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard of successful SaaS products like <a href="http://basecamp.com">Basecamp</a>, <a href="http://letsfreckle.com">Freckle</a>, and <a href="http://bidsketch.com">Bidsketch</a>. These were the companies that inspired us personally to go down the SaaS route. If they could do it, so could we...right?</p>
<p>
  I wish it were that simple! Building a <strong>bootstrapped</strong> SaaS business is really, really, really frickin&#39; hard.</p>
<p>
  You can have popular blog posts, a huge list, a successful beta. But without revenue streams besides your SaaS, it will likely fail in the first year.</p>
<p>
  That&#39;s right, your self-funded venture will fail if you don&#39;t do one of the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Sell a product/productized service (book, course, membership site, webinar, etc.)</li>
  <li>
    Sell a service (consulting)</li>
  <li>
    Sell your time (part- or full-time job)</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Most SaaS founders don&#39;t talk about this reality.</p>
<p>
  But <strong>a huge majority of the founders</strong> we&#39;ve talked to so far (<a href="http://howtobuildarocketship.com/podcast">on the podcast</a>) spend their first few months/years making their money from sources besides their SaaS product. And many of them continue offering high-end services far after their SaaS becomes &quot;successful.&quot;</p>
<p>
  Don&#39;t believe me? Trust me...we&#39;ve heard it first hand from entrepreneurs like <a href="https://twitter.com/brennandunn">Brennan Dunn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/toddo">Todd Garland</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/samuelhulick">Samuel Hulick</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/earthlingworks">Ruben Gamez</a>.</p>
<p>
  It&#39;s not fun or sexy to think about these sorts of things when you&#39;d much rather be spending your time working on your &quot;baby.&quot;</p>
<p>
  The thing that brings you closer to full freedom than you&#39;ve ever been. But the sooner you embrace this (we waited way too long), the longer your runway will be and the less stress you&#39;ll inflict on yourself and those around you. So let&#39;s get down to it:</p>

  **you have to find a way to get revenue while building. two of best ways are two listed, but even list building and book takes months. the safest route to revenue is consulting, and it shouldn&#39;t be seen as a failure if you&#39;re smart about it. charge a ton, be selective, don&#39;t let it distract from product. cut expenses ruthlessly. Even the people who you view as being most successful, and not taking client work...ARE taking client work. list names, drew wilson, samuel, brennan dunn, patrick. they&#39;re doing it smart/$$...but they&#39;re doing it. We do it too. We have one client paying 2k/month. It&#39;s not a lot but it also doesn&#39;t take much of our time. When you realize how hard it is to make 2k a month off a SaaS product, you&#39;ll think twice about saying no to recurring consulting revenue retainers.</p>
<p>
  Cheers,<br />
