<h1>The Road to SaaS Revenue is Painfully Slow. Are You Prepared for It?</h1>

<p>
  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard of successful SaaS products like <a href="http://basecamp.com">Basecamp</a>, <a href="http://letsfreckle.com">Freckle</a>, and <a href="http://bidsketch.com">Bidsketch</a>. These were the companies that inspired us personally to go down the SaaS route. If they could do it, so could we...right?</p>
<p>
  I wish it were that simple! Building a <strong>bootstrapped</strong> SaaS business is really, really, really frickin&#39; hard.</p>
<p>
  You can have popular blog posts, a huge list of prospects, a successful beta, and even launch into revenue/profit. But without revenue streams besides your SaaS, you will&nbsp;likely fail in the first year.</p>
<p>
  That&#39;s right, your self-funded venture will fail if you don&#39;t do one of the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Sell a product/productized service (book, course, membership site, webinar, etc.)</li>
  <li>
    Sell your time (consulting)</li>
  <li>
    Sell your time (part- or full-time job)</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Most SaaS founders don&#39;t talk about this reality.</p>
<p>
  But <strong>a huge majority of the founders</strong> we&#39;ve talked to so far (<a href="http://howtobuildarocketship.com/podcast">on the podcast</a>) spend their first few months/years making their money from sources besides their SaaS product. And many of them continue offering high-end services far after their SaaS becomes &quot;successful&quot;.</p>
<p>
  Don&#39;t believe me? We&#39;ve heard it first-hand from entrepreneurs like <a href="https://twitter.com/brennandunn">Brennan Dunn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/toddo">Todd Garland</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/drewwilson">Drew Wilson</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/earthlingworks">Ruben Gamez</a>.</p>
<p>
  It&#39;s not fun or sexy to think about these sorts of things when you&#39;d much rather be spending your time working on your baby: that one thing that brings you closer to full freedom than you&#39;ve ever been.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  But the sooner you embrace this <em>(we waited way too long),</em> the longer your runway will be and the less stress you&#39;ll inflict on yourself and those around you. So let&#39;s get down to it:</p>
<h2>
  0. Don&#39;t Turn Down (Good) Consulting Work</h2>
<p>
  We&#39;ve avoided consulting work like the plague. And it&#39;s been great...it&#39;s allowed us to push our products forward at a great rate. But even at a great rate, SaaS revenue takes a long time to build.</p>
<p>
  Absolutely turn down long-term contract projects that would distract you or your team. But think twice before rejecting/not pursuing retainer work.</p>
<p>
  I highly recommend <a href="http://doubleyourfreelancingrate.com/">Brennan&#39;s book</a>. It convinced us to charge 5x our normal rate on the only contract we&#39;ve taken since we started. His advice also helped us extend that job into a monthly retainer which is locked in for 12 months now, giving us some level of stability.</p>
<h2>
  1. Market Your Product before You Build It</h2>
<p>
  Before you start building your product, put up a simple, yet descriptive, page selling the dream (<a href="http://www.minimalytics.com">here&#39;s one of ours</a>). Don&#39;t use LaunchRock, and don&#39;t skimp on design. If you&#39;re truly keeping it simple, you should be able to find a great designer on Dribbble that will produce a style guide to keep you on track. I don&#39;t know about you, but when I see a half-assed landing page, I assume the eventual product won&#39;t have any polish/effort invested either.</p>
<p>
  This page is your calling card. Anyone you interact with on Twitter or in Email will be viewing your product&#39;s page and judging your competency as a maker. All of your future outreach/reputation as an entrepreneur depend on this page.</p>
<h2>
  2. Use this Marketing to Build a Personal Newsletter that Attracts Your Audience</h2>
<p>
  We&#39;ve been operating for nearly a year, and this is the first time we&#39;ve sat down and thought about what we could send of value to the folks that have signed up for the Small HQ list.</p>
<p>
  All of our prior focus has been on growing beta lists, and upon realizing how slow SaaS is, we&#39;re now making an attempt to grow the company outside of the SaaS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  What can you do to provide value to your audience on a regular basis, regardless of whether or not it supports your SaaS?</p>
<h2>
  3. Sell an eBook or other Non-SaaS Product to this Audience</h2>
<p>
  We started promoting our book about 6-9 months ago. Then it sat there, ignored. It wasn&#39;t until <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelsacca">Michael Sacca</a> approached us about partnering up on a broader book that we got our asses in gear. Since then, we&#39;ve started publishing our <a href="http://howtobuildarocketship.com/podcast">founder interviews</a>, and have many more plans for the <a href="http://howtobuildarocketship.com">Rocketship</a> brand.</p>
<p>
  We should have been doing all of this work last summer, but instead we were focused on building (and then rebuilding) our <a href="http://www.hookfeed.com">SaaS</a> <a href="http://www.minimalytics.com">products</a>.</p>
<p>
  Don&#39;t make the same mistake. Sell your knowledge, and give a lot away for free. Let that momentum fuel your product development.</p>
<h2>
  4. Build Your Product along the Way</h2>
<p>
  If you do everything right, you should have some side-revenue coming in from 1 or more non-SaaS products. More importantly, you will have built up relationships which can be turned into partnerships on other products/services.</p>
<p>
  It took us a very long time to realize what works and what doesn&#39;t, and we&#39;ve continued to be fairly non-deliberate in our actions. Moving forward, we&#39;re trying to be more strategic about where we spend our energy. Focusing most on revenue-driving activities, and less on distracting side-projects/our SaaS.</p>
<p>
  <em><span style="font-size:14px;">&quot;The end of 2013 marks roughly the three-year mark for my company. As I reflect on where we are today, from initial product, to an advisory round, to seed funding and then to raising our Series A in December 2013, one thing that I&rsquo;ve always perceived came true: <strong>it takes roughly 3 years for you to truly figure out if what you&rsquo;re working on can be a business.</strong>&quot; </span></em><br />
